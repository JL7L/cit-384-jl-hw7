          <h2 class="student-name">Student</h2>
          <p>
            As an Information Technology student, I have developed a strong
            foundation in various fields, such as computer programming, database
            management, networking, and cybersecurity. I am keenly interested in
            exploring emerging technologies and their potential applications in
            real-world scenarios. I am well-versed in various programming
            languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I have experience
            working with databases such as MySQL and Oracle. Additionally, I am
            familiar with network protocols and security best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a proactive learner, I constantly seek new opportunities to
            expand my skill set and apply my knowledge in practical settings. I
            am a team player and possess excellent communication and
            interpersonal skills, which enable me to collaborate effectively
            with colleagues and stakeholders. My ability to work under pressure
            and manage time efficiently allows me to handle multiple tasks
            simultaneously while maintaining high-quality output. I am a highly
            motivated individual with a strong passion for technology and a
            desire to impact the IT industry positively.
